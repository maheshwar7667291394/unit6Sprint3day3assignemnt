Q3/- What is the difference between setter injection and constructor injection?

constructru=or injection :-
It doesn’t allow to create circular dependency.
Constructor-based DI fixes the order in which the dependencies need to be injected.


seter injection Point:-
It doesn’t check the circular dependency.
Setter-based DI helps us to inject the dependency only when it is required, as opposed to requiring it at construction time.
